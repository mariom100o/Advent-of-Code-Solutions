# Advent of Code 2020 Day 2 Solution
I first parsed the input into a new datatype. Little did I know that one typo cost me about an hour of debugging. I incremented my index by too little, leaving me with a space at the start of every password. This did not affect part one, leading me to believe it was written correctly. After writing my second part, I found it did not work. After searching for about 30 minutes, I finally found something! I was happy to finally be done, but it still was not correct. I spent quite a bit just looking over my function, when the problem was hidden in the parsing. Only after I printed my password, I realized my problem.
