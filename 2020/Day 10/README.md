# Advent of Code 2020 Day 10 Solution
Parsing was simple, I just put all the numbers in a vector. Part one was also simple, I sorted the vector and just recorded all the differences into three variables: oneDiff, twoDiff, and threeDiff. For part two, I used dynamic programming. For each element in the ratings vector, I stored how many ways you could get to that point in a vector. For each, I would check if you could get to that point from the rating three, two, and one steps back. If I could, I add the number of ways to get to them respectively. Finally, I could return the last element of the vector.
