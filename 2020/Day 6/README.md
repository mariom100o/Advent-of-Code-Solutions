# Advent of Code 2020 Day 6 Solution
Parsing was similar to day 4. I built upon a variable until I reached an empty line and pushed it back into a vector. For part one, I had a vector of size 26 for each letter in the alphabet. Each time I encountered a letter I would increment the corresponding value in the vector. For each value that was over one I could increment the total for the group. All of these totals added up gave me the answer. For part two, I had a members value which stores how many people were in a group. If the count of a character, for example 'a' was equal to the members, it meant all of the members answered yes for that letter. Finding the total of each group's total me the answer.
