# Advent of Code 2020 Day 13 Solution
To parse, I stored the first line into an int and the second line in a vector of strings. For the first part, I found the closest timestamp to the departure time for each ID. If it was before, I would go to the next timestamp. Then I could simply see which bus ID was closest to our departure time. The second part was tricky, I had to brute force it, which took quite a bit of time. I looped until I found the earliest timestamp with matching offsets, incrementing by the frequency each time. The frequency was how often the first and thrid bus IDs overlap. In each loop, I checked if each bus ID matched the offset.
