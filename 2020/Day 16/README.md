# Advent of Code 2020 Day 16 Solution
Parsing took me the longest it ever has before. I eventually stored my ticket in a seprate vector, then stored nearby tckets in a vector of vectors. Finally, I stored the fields in a vector of datatype fields. The fields datatype contained each start position and each end position. For part one, I just went through every ticket and checked if it didn't meet any field. I add to my sum, remove it and carry on if it didn't. Part two was a bit harder. I had a vectore of vector of bools that stored which columns used which fields. Then I narrowed down the fields used by finding ones that only use one field and removing that field from any other column. I eventually get which columns use which field.
