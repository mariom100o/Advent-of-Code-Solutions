# Advent of Code 2020 Day 7 Solution
This was by far the hardest puzzle of day 2020. It took may quite a while! For part 1,  stored all the bags in a vector of vectors. The 0th position of a vector would be the parent bag, and everything following is what's inside that bag. To find how many bags contain a shiny gold bag, I looped through every 0th position and checked if it's children eventually become a shiny gold bag. I would store the bags that become shiny gold in an undordered set. The second part took me a bit longer. I would continually multiple the number of bags with the number of nested bags and add it to the total. Then I add 1 to also include the parent bag itself.
