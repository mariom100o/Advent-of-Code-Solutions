# Advent of Code 2020 Day 3 Solution
This seemed like a fun and interesting puzzle at first. I knew exactly what I wanted to do. Then, things started going down hill (pun not intended). There was yet another issue that cost me about an hour of debugging. I kept getting the wrong output because it was saying the size of the vector was 1 more than it actually was! I found out that it was because my text file uses the CRLF end of line format (Windows), but I was compiling with g++ in linux which resulted in the carriage return character '\r' being counted in the size. This resulted in me not properly wrapping around.
